# Job-Seeking-Portal-Full-Stack
This project is a comprehensive job portal platform developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It enables users to browse job listings, apply for positions, and manage job applications. Employers can post job opportunities, manage applicants, and track the status of their job postings.
I see that you've uploaded a zip file titled "job platform fullstack." I can help you create a project description based on this file. Let me first extract and review the contents.

  Features:
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration for both job seekers and employers.
- Job Listings:Browse and search for job opportunities based on various filters such as location, job type, and company.

- Employer Dashboard:Employers can manage job postings, view applicants, and update job statuses.
- Responsive UI:The frontend is built using React, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- Backend Services:The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, with MongoDB for data storage. It also includes cloud storage integration for handling file uploads.

 Technologies Used:
- Frontend: React, Redux, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- Additional Tools:Cloudinary for file storage, JWT for authentication, and more.

  How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the backend directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the backend server using `npm start`.
4. Navigate to the frontend directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies, and start the frontend with `npm start`.

This project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, particularly in creating scalable web applications with a focus on user experience and functionality.
